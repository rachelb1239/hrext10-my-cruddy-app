 ## Version 1.0

Create a milage tracking app that allows user to add, update, or delete entries in local storage. User should be able to track vehicle info with following values: date, starting milage, ending milage, purpose of trip.

 ## Version 1.1 Requirements
- [ ] Change Date to be the KEY instead of a key-value pair with the stats object as the value
- [ ] Allow object to be added too if date entered doesn't already exist
- [ ] Enforce valid data type on inputs (e.g. date should be a valid date)

 
 ## Wishlist
- [ ] Allow for multiple entries on same date
- [ ] Display calculated miles
- [ ] Refactor to be more ES6 esque (kill the vars)
- [ ] Transform into car stats app to also track maintanence records with dates
- [ ] Ability to update/delete directly table (suggestion from class)
